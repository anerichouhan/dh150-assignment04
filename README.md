### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**

This project will rework the current TechCrunch website to provide users with a more efficient way of *discovering*, *consuming*, and *revisiting* online articles on Technology and Business. The new experience will make users have a more enjoyable time with online articles and will enable them to more efficiently find content they are interested in.


**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

The activity fulfills the basic need of esteem because it is focuses on acquiring knowlege and thought leadership that may give the user an esteemed sense of self-confidence. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

The current solutions for consuming online articles on tech andf Business range across a variety of platforms like Medium, Techcrunch, Product Hunt, Apple news app etc. Users often directly search for articles on Google and then go to sites that have the content they are looking for. Many are also subscribed to newsletters that link to articles. These newsletters include Morning Brew, Product Hunt etc. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Looking at the current landscape, one aspect to improve would be the overall experience of content discovery. It is often difficult for users to find content that they best enjoy because many of these sites, particularly the Techcrunch one often have an overwhelming amount of content without adequate categorization. Another aspect that could be worked on is the experience of storing and revisitng online content.
