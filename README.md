### ✅ Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**

This project will rework the current TechCrunch website to provide users with a more efficient way of *discovering*, *consuming*, and *revisiting* online articles on Technology and Business. The new experience will make users have a more enjoyable time with online articles and will enable them to more efficiently find content they are interested in.


**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

The activity fulfills the basic need of esteem because it is focuses on acquiring knowlege and thought leadership that may give the user an esteemed sense of self-confidence. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

The current solutions for consuming online articles on tech andf Business range across a variety of platforms like Medium, Techcrunch, Product Hunt, Apple news app etc. Users often directly search for articles on Google and then go to sites that have the content they are looking for. Many are also subscribed to newsletters that link to articles. These newsletters include Morning Brew, Product Hunt etc. People also use audio versions of the content through podcasts. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Looking at the current landscape, one aspect to improve would be the overall experience of content discovery. It is often difficult for users to find content that they best enjoy because many of these sites, particularly the Techcrunch one often have an overwhelming amount of content without adequate categorization. Another aspect that could be worked on is the experience of storing and revisitng online content. 

### ✅ Step 2: Identify Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
The target users for the website are students or working professionals who are pursuing a career related to technology or business, as well as individuals with a general interest in tech and business. 
The users own smart phones or laptops, and enjoy reading and learning. Users do not need any particular expertise to use the site, however they might need domain knowledge to better understand some of the content. 

**Where would the users do that activity?**
Users may perform the activity of discovering and consuming content in a variety of contexts. Some may have a daily morning routine to consume content, some do so while commuting through public transport, some do so whenever they have blocks of free time during their day. Many rely on prompts from newsletters or other reminders to open up content and read their daily bit. Users could use laptops or cell phones to consume the content. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
Users would go to the Techcrunch website and pick online articles from recommedations. The could also explore content easily through effective categorization of content. They would be able to interact with the content and save it to a personal library is they wish to do so.

### ✅ Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
I opted for a remote user interview with particpirory observation. I framed a set of questions to understand the overall context, motivations, and behaviors of my target user. I also asked them to share their screen as I observed their interaction with online content.
